    <h1>Semi-transparent profile pictures for Twitter</h1>
    This tool allows you to make your profile picture semi-transparent pictures.<br>
    Here's an example:<br>
    <input type="checkbox" hidden id="toggle-dark-mode"><img src="example.png" alt="Example image"><br>
    <label for="toggle-dark-mode">Toggle light/dark mode</label><br>
    (This doesnt change the image, just the background.)<br>

    You can <a href="/login">Log in with Twitter</a> to use a semi-transparent profile picture.<br>
    <br>
    FAQ:
    <details>
        <summary>How does this work?</summary>
        This effect works by making the background of images semi-transparent so that
        they affect the color without completely overlaying the background of your theme.

    <details>
        <summary>Why do I have to log in? Can't I just set the PFP myself?</summary>
        You have to log in because when you crop a transparent picture on Twitter you
        loose the transparency and you are forced to crop your profile picture on Twitter Web and
        the Twitter Apps, but bots do not have that limitation so you can use a bot like this one
        to set a transparent profile picture.

    <details>
        <summary>Why does the app need so many permissions?</summary>
        To write profile settings (like the profile picture)
        you need the Read+Write permissions for an app, and you cant select only a few of those
        permissions, you can only specify Read, Read+Write or Read+Write+DM.
        So dont worry if Twitter asks you for a million
        permissions - I only use one (or two if you tweet about it) permission(s).
